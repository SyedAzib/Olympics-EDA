🏅 Olympics Data Analysis (EDA)
This project analyzes the 120 years of Olympic history (Athletes and Results) dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The notebook covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to uncover insights about athlete participation, medal counts, and trends over time.

Athlete with the most medals

Gender participation trends over time

📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes several plots created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand Olympic history, such as:

Athletes participation over time

Top 10 countries by medal count

Distribution of athlete ages

Gender participation trends over the years

Sports with the highest number of events

Emerging vs declining sports across Olympics
